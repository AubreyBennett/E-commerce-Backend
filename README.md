## Getting Started/Initialization

You’ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

Open terminal and use `npm i` to install all packages above. Install seeds using `node seeds` or `npm run seed`. Start the application with `npm start`.
